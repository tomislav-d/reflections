How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Because lines that are different are marked with a plus or a minus, I looked at only those lines. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I guess it is easier to find bugs and write more efficient, simpler code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    With git I can choose what to save. automatic saving can save at the wrong time when code is not finished and can make too many versions of a file.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    I think it's because google docs are not intendended to be a part of programm, so it is not important for files to be connected, while with program files it is opposite.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log to see changes made to the file and diff to see lines that are different

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    i can go back to previous version and revert changes, and also compare two commits
